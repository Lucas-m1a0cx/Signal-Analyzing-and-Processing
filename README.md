# Signal Analyzing and Processing
This repository is composed of three parts:
- Homework(Using MATLAB): 
  - HW02: Basic concolution calculus on time domain
  - HW03: Fourier coefficients and Fourier transform
  - HW04: Fourier transform and inverse transform
  - HW05: Basic discrete signals' calculation on time domain
  - HW06: DTFT and DFS
  - HW07: Z-transform and its inverse
  - HW08: Systems' reactions to different inputs
- Lab: 
  - Lab01: Sampling and recovery of signals
  - Lab02: Amplitude modulation and demodulation
  - Lab03: Passive filter and active filter
- Final Project: A little audio processing tool and more information in detail can be seen in our project paper.
    - Function 1: Recognize particular songs 
    - Function 2: Filter the songs and control the speed
